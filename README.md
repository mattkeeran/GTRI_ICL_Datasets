# GTRI ICL Exploration and Analysis Datasets
This repo is meant as a placeholder for the datasets approved for data exploration and analysis for interviewing with the GTRI ICL team. Each folder represents a different dataset that can be selected for exploration and analysis.

## Instructions
Before attending the in-person interview, we at GTRI would like to give you the opportunity to show your best potential by completing a data exploration and analysis exercise. This exercise is not meant as a brain teaser, there are no 'gotcha' instances within the data. We simply would like to get a glimpse of how you review, explore and summarize data.

The only requirement within this exercise is to use python (2 or 3). You are free to use any graphic library (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

Please fork this repository and push your code to your own personal repository for review. Be sure to add comments within your code to explain your thought process and steps taken
